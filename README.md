# Overview
I made this program to demonstrate that I learned how to write in Java!
Setting up the environment in VSCode was ridiculous, and it also took a long
time because I didn't know that there was a difference between Java and
Javascript... I thought they were the same!

# Development Environment
    * VS Code
    * Git
    * Java 15

# New Knowledge
I now know that Java and Javascript are different! I also think that it's
interesting that Java is entirely object-oriented, using a 'Main' class
to run everything.
